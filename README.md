# About me 🎲
Hey there! I'm **17 years old** and just starting out in the world of programming 🚀.  
Currently, I'm taking a **technical course in Web Development at SENAI** 💻, where I'm learning how to build websites and applications from the ground up.

I'm **passionate about learning new programming languages** 🧠 and constantly looking to expand my knowledge in tech. I love challenging myself with something new every day — be it a concept, a tool, or a different way of thinking 🛠️.

📚 Outside of coding, I also really enjoy reading. I believe that books are a powerful way to explore ideas, spark creativity, and gain new perspectives.

I'm full of curiosity and motivation to grow as a developer 🌱. I'm just getting started, but I'm excited about the journey ahead!
